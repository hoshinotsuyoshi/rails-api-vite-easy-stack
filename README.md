# Monorepo for Rails GraphQL API and Vite + React SPA

This monorepo hosts two main applications:
- A **Rails GraphQL API** running in API mode located in `./backend`
- A **Vite + React Single Page Application (SPA)** located in `./frontend`

## üí™ Backend Development

The backend is a Rails application running in API mode. Below are the key steps for setting up and running the backend:

1. **Managing Dependencies**
   To install backend dependencies, use Bundler to install all gems from the `Gemfile`:
   ```bash
   # cd ./backend
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   Ensure the database is properly set up. You can spin up the required services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   # cd ./backend
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Initial Setup**
   To initialize the application (e.g., creating the database, running migrations), run the setup script:
   ```bash
   # cd ./backend
   bin/setup
   ```

4. **Start Server**
   To start the Rails server for development, use the following command:
   ```bash
   # cd ./backend
   bin/dev
   ```

5. **Run Tests**
   To run the test suite, use RSpec:
   ```bash
   # cd ./backend
   bundle exec rspec
   ```

## üß© `graphql-schema` Directory and GraphQL Schema Code-First Approach

This project adopts a **Code-First** approach to defining GraphQL schemas using the `graphql-ruby` gem. Here‚Äôs how the backend and frontend integrate using GraphQL schemas:

1. **Update GraphQL Schema in Backend**
   Use the available rake task in the backend to update the GraphQL schema and output it to the `graphql-schema` directory:
   ```bash
   # cd ./backend
   bin/rails graphql:schema:dump
   ```

2. **Generate TypeScript Types in Frontend**
   Run the following command in the frontend to generate TypeScript types based on the updated GraphQL schema:
   ```bash
   # cd ./frontend
   bun run graphql-codegen
   ```

   This process ensures that the types are correctly synchronized between the backend and frontend, facilitating type-safe GraphQL queries in the frontend.

## üí™ Frontend Development

The frontend is a Vite-powered React SPA, and Bun is used as the package manager. The primary build scripts are defined in `frontend/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-spa",
  "packageManager": "bun@1.1.31",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "build:move": "bun run build && bun run move-assets",
    "move-assets": "rsync -av --delete dist/index.html ../backend/public/ && rsync -av --delete dist/assets/ ../backend/public/assets/ && touch ../backend/public/assets/.keep",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "graphql-codegen": "graphql-codegen"
  }
}
```

Key commands include:
- `bun run dev`: Starts the Vite development server for live preview.
- `bun run build`: Builds the production assets for deployment.
- `bun run build:move`: Builds the frontend and moves the build artifacts into the Rails public directory.
- `bun run graphql-codegen`: Generates TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema.

## Deployment Process (üöß)

> [!TIP]
> This section is still under construction.

The deployment process involves building the frontend, syncing the build artifacts to the Rails `public/` directory using `rsync`, and building the Docker image for the Rails API.

### Steps:

1. **Build the frontend and Move frontend build artifacts to Rails**
   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the build command using Bun. This compiles the React app and outputs the assets to `backend/public/assets`:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && bun run build:move
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**
   After the assets are moved, the Rails backend can be built into a Docker image:
   ```bash
   cd backend && docker build -t my-spa .
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   Deploy the application using your preferred method (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or any CI/CD pipeline).

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Key Features of the Rails Application

The Rails API serves as the backend for the SPA and manages authentication and routing for the client. Below are some technical highlights of the Rails setup.

---

### 1. Authentication

#### Based on Rails 8's `bin/rails generate authentication`
This application leverages the Rails 8 authentication generator. Certain methods unnecessary for API mode have been commented out. During login mutations, filtered `request` information is exposed through `context`, allowing mutations in `app/graphql/mutations` to handle session data.

#### Secure Cookie-Based Sessions
This app uses `Set-Cookie` with `http-only` attributes for secure session management in a same-origin setup, avoiding the complexities of CORS, JWTs, or local storage solutions. Cookies are a well-established security measure and can help prevent some (albeit very limited) XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring that JavaScript cannot access session data.

#### API Mode and Cookie Management
The Rails API uses `ActionController::Cookies` to enable cookie-based sessions even in API mode, making client-side authentication seamless.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  include ActionController::Cookies
end
```

---

### 2. Routing and Static Assets Management

Given that both backend and frontend must run on the same origin, care has been taken to avoid routing conflicts. The Rails API operates primarily through a single endpoint: `POST /graphql`. All other paths are reserved for frontend usage.

The `StaticController` serves the frontend's `index.html` for specified routes. Example routes:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
[
  "/login",
  "/me",
  "/signup"
].each { get _1, to: "static#index" }
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/static_controller.rb
class StaticController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render plain: Rails.public_path.join('index.html').read, layout: false
  end
end
```

---

### 3. Signup Flow

The signup process follows a series of steps starting with the frontend collecting user details and making GraphQL mutations to create and authenticate users. Each step in the flow interacts with the backend API, which manages session creation and validation through GraphQL mutations.

---

### 4. System Test

Rails system tests are powered by Capybara and Puma. They use transactional database cleaning to ensure isolated tests, allowing easy testing of both frontend and backend interactions in an integrated environment.
